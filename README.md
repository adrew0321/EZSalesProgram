# EZSalesProgram
A Point-Of-Sale System created to handle different Imported and Regular Tax calculations


Welcome to the EZ Sales Program Version 1.0

Design Idea: The initial goal was to create Point-Of-Sale Sytem that would provide a customizable experince to the end user. While sticking to the requirements of the project, I wanted to provide an "anoynmous" way of structure by tailoring the users responses. Matching this with the option of custom responses removes further room for error.

I believe in the S.O.L.I.D Priciples along with OOP; so having my codebase focus on a separation of concerns provided me with more flexibility when developing. By creating multiple classes, methods to increase functionality, using inhertance to tap into base classes along with other modules; it further help provide more security to the overall flow of the project. If something breaks (which it definitely did in some places) I'm able to identify and begin developing a fix. Thus providing continues improvement to the overall project.
  
The possibilities of assumptions to the consumer can be consuming; the rabbit hole I should refer to it as. Below I've provided a list of Assumptions that sent me through the ringer:
	- what if the user inserts whitespace?
	- what if user spelling of the item is wrong?
	- what if user doesn't fully insert dollar amount? (15 instead of 15.00)
	- How are we adding/removing new items?
	- How are we separating concerns?
	- If the program crashes; will the end user know?
	- How can we handle validation?
	- how do we calucalte multiple items of the same price while taking in account for sale taxes and included imported sale taxs?
  	- what are payment options?

Overall the project was fun to create and develop. I was able tto discover new and crafty fixes and was consistenly challenged!
